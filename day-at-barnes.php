                                <h3>1. Dedicated Boarding Staff</h3>
                                <p>At Barnes School and Junior College , we entrust our students’ care under a team
                                    of experienced wardens, matrons, boarding in chargers, and pastoral caregivers
                                    who dedicate themselves to support the students. Each dormitory has a warden or
                                    matron along with a Boarding in charge who create a safe and nurturing abode ,
                                    ensuring that the student lives in a safe and supportive environment. The students’
                                    wellbeing is our top priority , ensuring that they are mentored and guided
                                    towards success.</p>
                                <h3>2. Houses & Community Living</h3>
                                <p>The residential houses foster a strong sense of community and belonging . Each
                                    dormitory operates as a family encouraging camaraderie, healthy competition, and
                                    growth . Inter-house activities such as sports or co-curricular activities provide
                                    opportunities for students to showcase their talent and develop life skills
                                    which enhances them to be future leaders.</p>

                                <p>The importance of academics cannot be understated. Boarding students benefit from a
                                    structured schedule where there is a balance of academics and sports. Morning
                                    and evening study hours are supervised by staff . Remedial sessions are held
                                    for students before examinations as well. These ensure that our students continue to
                                    grow, remain focused and maintain consistency.</p>
