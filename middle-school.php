                                    Grades 5 to 8—is a vibrant and nurturing space where students grow academically,
                                    socially, and emotionally. With a strong focus on holistic education, our program is
                                    designed to encourage curiosity, creativity, and character in every student.</p>
                                <p>The academic year runs from April to March, divided into two terms, and includes four
                                    main breaks: August Break, Diwali Break, Christmas Break, and the Summer Holidays.
                                    Students attend school from 8:00 AM to 2:10 PM. Each day begins with a special zero
                                    period—a dedicated hour for extracurriculars—followed by eight academic periods,
                                    with a short mid-day break.</p>
